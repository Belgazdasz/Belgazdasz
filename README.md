Hello,


My name is Belgazdasz or Bélgazdász.

I'm a beginner in Python, I'm also studying Lua.
I speak English, Hungarian and I'm learing German.




How to pronounce my name correctly:


  1 B a normal B nothing special

  2 É an ée like in 'fiancée'

  3 L self explaining

  4 G not like a j, more like a 'Gun'

  5 A like in 'Call'

  6 Z again, pronounce normally

  7 D a strong D like in 'Do'

  8 Á /ɑː/ as in 'File'

  9 SZ pronounce it like a normal 'S'

Thank you for reading,
✨Bélgazdász✨
